# Machine Learning for Trading

This repository contains Python code for analyzing stock market data and visualizing stock price movements. The code utilizes pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to perform data manipulation and visualization tasks.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system, along with the required libraries: pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-for-trading.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd machine-learning-for-trading
3. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
4. Place the CSV file containing the stock data (e.g., `STOCK_DATA_FINAL.csv`) in the project directory.

5. Run the Python script:
  python program.py
This will execute the code and display a plot showing the stock prices over the specified date range.

## File Structure

- `program.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the code for reading the stock data, creating dataframes, and plotting the stock prices.
- `STOCK_DATA_FINAL.csv`: This is the CSV file containing the stock data. The file should have a "Date" column and columns for each stock you want to analyze.

## Code Overview

The `program.py` script contains two main functions:

1. `test_run()`: This function reads the stock data from the CSV file, creates an empty DataFrame with a date range, and joins the stock data with the empty DataFrame. It returns the stock data DataFrame.

2. `plot_data(df1, title)`: This function takes a DataFrame containing the stock data and a title for the plot. It plots the stock prices over the date range and displays the plot.

The main script calls the `test_run()` function to retrieve the stock data DataFrame and then passes it to the `plot_data()` function to create the plot.

## Customization

You can customize the code to suit your specific needs. For example, you can modify the date range, add more stocks to the CSV file, or change the plot styling and labeling.
